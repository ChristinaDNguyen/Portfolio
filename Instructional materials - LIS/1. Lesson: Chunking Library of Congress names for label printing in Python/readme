This lesson is a practical example of a Python code that does the following:

- takes a CSV file (Excel file) containing Library of Congress classifications (ex. BX100)
- and splits it into chunks of x-length characters
- prints those chunks out again as columns side-by-side.

This example is from the Newman Centre Library's collection of materials and their classifcations.
