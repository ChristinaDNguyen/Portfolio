This lesson is a practical example of an R code that does the following:

- takes a CSV file (Excel file) containing Library of Congress classifications (ex. BX1001)
- and splits it into chunks of x-length characters
- prints those chunks out again as columns side-by-side.

This example is from the Newman Centre Library's collections of materials and their classifications. 
It was used to create printable labels to go on the side of materials for cataloguing, as an easy way to import
a CSV file into the label printer column-by-column. For example, the printer could now print the labels as

______
| BX1 |
| 001 |
______
