#To ensure the integrity of preserved files, archivists and librarians can use Python to calculate and validate checksums.
#"Integrity of preserved files" means checking the files every so often the make sure that they haven't corrupted, and that
#they still contain the same information each time you check it.

            sha256.update(chunk)
    return sha256.hexdigest()
