#In this sample, let's assume the metadata is stored in a file called "metadata.json"
#You can run all sorts of analyses on the metadata, including see which years were most common, which is the min and max year, etc.
#This gives you a good idea of which year most/least of your materials came from, or which year you have absolutely
#no content from.

# Load required libraries
install.packages("jsonlite")  # If not already installed

# Read JSON data from file

# Display the data frame
print(metadata_df)

# Basic statistics on the "year" field
